Here are some modules of bioinformatics written in python.  
Make sure you've python installed on your machine to execute them i.e it's accessible through the terminal.

## Installation and run module

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory that you want to store the repository on your machine.
- Clone the repository:
```
    git clone https://github.com/Nick-Kevin/Bioinformatics-in-Python.git
```
- Change the directory to the new folder:
```
    cd Bioinformatics-in-Python
```
- Run module: now you have to run moudules  
 eg:
```
    python hamming_distance.py
```
 or
```
    python3 hamming_distance.py
```

### Hamming distance
Hamming distance is a metric for comparing two binary data strings or strings data. While comparing two binary strings of equal length, Hamming distance is the number of bit positions in which the two bits are different.
But here, the bit is replaced by character because of comparing two ADN. 

The Hamming distance between two strings, a and b is denoted as d(a,b).
### Levenshtein distance
